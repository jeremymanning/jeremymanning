Hi!  I'm a psych professor and the director of the [Contextual Dynamics Lab](https://github.com/ContextLab) at [Dartmouth College](https://www.dartmouth.edu).  I build models of memory and brain networks, build tools, teach some open courses, and do various other data sciencey things.  I'm also a dad, husband, nature enthusiast, and amateur cupcake baker!

Check out my [lab website](https://www.context-lab.com/) for more information about my lab, research, papers, and code!
